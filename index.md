 <ol style="font-family: Garamond, Baskerville; font-size:11pt; font-style:normal" >  
 <li> I'm a third-year sociology PhD student in the Sociology Department at UC Berkeley. I am broadly interested in contemporary American families. I focus on family change and study topics on the family ranging from marriage and social boundaries to intergenerational process (e.g., the transmission of advantage or disadvantage across generations. Iâ€™ve mainly worked with quantitative data but also have experience working with qualitative data. I have extensive training in R and State, some training in Python, and some training with NVivo. </li>
